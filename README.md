# Task1_cv
## Overview
our project is an educational website that performs many functions on uploaded images and visualizing the effect of each of these functions by displaying the output and input images to show difference between them.
## Features
 * Add additive noise to any image as: Uniform, Gaussian and salt & pepper noise.
 * Filter the noisy image using low pass filters as: Average, Gaussian and median filters.
 * Detect edges in the image using masks as: Sobel , Roberts , Prewitt and Canny edge detectors.
 * Draw histogram and distribution curve of uploaded images.
 * Equalization and normalization of image.
 * Local and global thresholding for uploaded image.
 * Transformation from color image to gray scale image and plot of R, G, and B
 histograms with its distribution function (cumulative curve that you use it for mapping and histogram equalization).
 * Applying frequency domain filters as: high pass and low pass filters.
 * Uploading any two images and showing their hybrid output
